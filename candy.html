					<p>Sweet or sour? Chocolate or caramel? Chocolate? White, milk, or dark chocolate? Snickers,
						KitKat, or Milky Way? No matter your favorite candy, you can probably walk down the aisles of
						your local grocery on a mid October day and buy a trashbag sized bag of it. Halloween is the most
						popular time for candy sales, but what makes the most popular candies so popular? For this
						project, we investigated if nutritional information could potentially be used as in indicator for consumer purchasing (i.e. grams of sugar, water content, or grams of
						protein) and candy popularity.</p>



					<hr class="major" />


					<h2>Extract</h2>
					<p>We selected two CSVs as our data sources</p>
					<li>A ranking of Halloween candy that people most prefer from FiveThirtyEight, created through a
						poll of 8,371 IP addresses on FiveThirtyEight.com. This CSV contains candy names, categories
						(‘fruity’, ‘chocolate’ etc), win percent (popularity), price percent, and sugar percent. The
						article in which we sourced our data can be found <a
							href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking/">here</a>
						and the CSV from Github can be found <a
							href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv">here</a>.
					</li>
					<li>Our nutritional data was extracted from the USDA’s food composition standard reference. The USDA
						is a reliable and standardized source for nutritional information that provides downloadable
						csvs of their data. We chose to use the abbreviated SR28ABXL.Zip file because this contained the
						most relevant columns for our use (the non-abbreviated version contains information on alcohol,
						caffeine, theobromine and many other nutrient contents that we weren’t interested in examining).
						We selected the excel format because this would be easiest to manipulate as a csv. <a
							href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/methods-and-application-of-food-composition-laboratory/mafcl-site-pages/sr11-sr28/">The
							USDA CSV used.</a> </li>

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Transform</h2>
					<h3>Cleaning, filtering, merging</h3>
					<p>The USDA provides data on all food types, so after importing the csv into a dataframe, we
						identified that we would need to split the ‘Shrt_Desc’ column to extract the relevant food
						category (‘Candies’) and candy name. We split the ‘Shrt_Desc’ column on commas, and performed a
						.loc to extract foods in the ‘Candies’ category, and then dropped columns with ‘None’ values. We
						ended up with 134 rows of candy, and exported this to a new csv file. 5. Part of our
						transformation took place in Excel, where we had to change the names that the USDA had given
						various candies to match the candy names in the FiveThirtyEight dataset (i.e ‘Butterfinger Candy
						Bar’ to ‘Butterfinger’). Since the dataset was relatively small, it was faster to do this by
						copy-pasting from the FiverThirtyEight CSV into the extracted USDA candy dataset in Excel rather
						than cleaning the names programmatically.</p>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="split.png" alt="" width="100px" height="500px" /></span>
					<p>Once our candy names matched, we created dataframes for both csvs using pandas and removed
						foreign characters from the resulting candy names.</p>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="changenames.png" alt="" width="100px" height="500px" /></span>
					<p>We changed the column names to increase ease of formatting to our relational database, and then
						merged our CSVs on our candy name columns using an inner join, thus dropping any columns with
						incomplete data. </p>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="newcolumns.png" alt="" width="100px" height="500px" /></span>
					<p>We then dropped any irrelevant columns (like the USDA database number) and duplicates. We ended
						up with 34 rows.</p>

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Load</h2>
					<p>We loaded our final data table into a relational database in PostgreSQL called ‘candy’ (merged in
						pandas so no need to join in SQL). A relational database is easy to scale and maintain data
						integrity, so we thought for this small database with potentially many more entries, that this
						made the most sense.</p>

					<h3>Using the ETL method, we created a database that is now employer ready for use on potential
						projects.</h3>
