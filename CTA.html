						<h1>CTA Ridership vs. Chicago Crime</h1>
					</header>

					<span class="image main"><img src="CTA.jpg" alt="" /></span>


					<h2>Inspiration</h2>
					<p>Millions of people rely on the Chicago Transit Authority everyday to to get them where they need
						to go. However, does increased levels of crime on the CTA cause individuals to find new methods
						of transportation? Additionally, do we see a trend in increased ridership as crime rate
						declines?</p>
					<p>The goal of this project was to compare frequency of Chicago crime against the frequency of CTA
						ridership on year to year bases. </p>

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Data</h2>
					<p>Chicago provides full transparency data of all the crimes that take place in the city on their <a
							href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/dataset/crime.html"> government website</a>. The CTA
						also provides <a href="https://www.transitchicago.com/data/"> open source data</a> of all
						ridership by year. </p>


					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Extract and Transform</h2>
					<p> The extraction of the data from the sources was done using Pandas, a software in Python. Both
						datasets were quite sizable, with CTA data containing 6939 rows and Chicago crime dataset
						containing 11,580 rows. Thus, this required a good amount of cleaning up and sizing down before
						we began analysis.</p>

					<p>First extract CTA ridership data and remove unwated columns.</p>

					<!--Break-->

					<p>Then extract Chicago crime data and remove unwanted columns.</p>

					<span class="image fit"><img src="import_crime_data.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p>Now that the data had been extracted, it was time to do a bit more cleaning up. Due to COVID-19,
						we decided to exclude the year 2020 ridership data. We did not feel that data from the year 2020
						would provide accurate representation of normal ridership. Therefor, we needed to drop all
						data from after 2019.</p>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="filtered_crime_date.png" alt="" /></span>

					<p>After all of our unwanted rows and columns were removed, it was time to merge the two datasets to
						get out final dataset.</p>

					<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
					<p>During our analysis there were many questions that needed to be addressed. Those questions
						included: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>What years had the highest ridership and what days had the highest amount of crime?</li>
						<li>What are the top crimes we see on the CTA?</li>
						<li>Do the days of most and least amount of ridership coincide with days of highest and lowest
							crime?</li>
						<li>Does our data show an overall correlation? </li>
					</ul>

					<h3>What years had the highest ridership and what days had the highest amount of crime?</h3>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
							<div class="box alt">
								<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
									<div class="col-10"><span class="image fit"><img src="crime_rate_by_year.png"
												alt="" /></span></div>
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="col-6 col-12-small">

								<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
									<div class="col-10"><span class="image fit"><img src="rider_count_by_year.png"
												alt="" /></span></div>
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>Upon plotting crime rate against CTA ridership, we found that we could see trends in the data.
						With the significant drop of crime in 2015 we can see an increase in ridership. Then as crime
						rate starts to increase again, we notice a decile in ridership. This lead us to believe we were
						on to a signicicant correlation. </p>

					<h3>What are the top crimes?</h3>




					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
							<div class="box alt">
								<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
									<div class="col-10"><span class="image fit"><img
												src="crimes_from_2001-2009_on_CTA.png" alt="" /></span></div>
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
							<div class="box alt">
								<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
									<div class="col-10"><span class="image fit"><img src="top_5_crimes.png"

						</div>
						<p>Theft triumphs as most popular crime in Chicago and on the CTA (first graph repsents crimes
							in all of chicago and second graph represents crimes on CTA). However, we
							believed that the crimes that would alter any sort of ridership and that would get news
							coverage would be violent crimes. Therefor, we decided to elliminate all crimes from our
							data that were not violent crimes. </p>

						<h3>What days had the highest ridership and what days had the highest amount of crime?</h3>
						<p>Any Chciago native can tell you that the busiest and roudiest days of the year udoubtably
							fall on days that the Chicago Cubs have a home game. Most Chicago residents will avoid any
							stop near Wrigley Field, because they know their fate will look like being jampacked in the train
							or bus with hundreds of Cubs Fans. So it was to no suprise that on November 4th of 2016,
							during the Cubs parade, Chicago experienced its highest crime rate and its highest amount
							ridership from 2001 to 2019. </p>
						<p>Christmas day of 2004 was a quiet day for the CTA, when it experience its lowest amount of
							ridership from 2001 to 2019. Coincidentlty, it seems the Christmas spirit stretched all
							throughout Chicago that day, because Chicago also experienced its lowest amount of crime on
							a
							given day from 2001 to 2019.</p>

						<h3>Does our data show an overall correlation? </h3>
						<p>Since we seemed to be on a pretty convincing path that crime does in fact effect CTA train
							ridership, we decided to investigate if our data had any real statistical significance.</p>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="correlation.png" alt="" width="100px" height="500px" /></span>

						<hr>

						<h2>Results</h2>
						<p>Although our plotting lead us to believe that there could be trends leading to our
							hypothesis, we found no statistical sidnificance in our data. If we were to take this project
							further, we would look deeper into the day-by-day crime versus ridership to see if there is
							a signicant correlation between them on a day to day basis instead of years. We would also
							investigate other potenetial causes for the steep decrease in crime in 2015.</p>
